# Raster_WMCA_sample
3 small rasters samples to use the Weighted Muilti-Criteria Analysis WMCA plugin

The geology.tif have pixel's values from 0 (noData) up to 62.0 while geomorphology.tif have values from 0 (noData) up to 450.0 and the pedology.tif have values from 0 up to 220 and is a multiband raster. The plugin is intended to be used with single band rasters, so only band 1 will be considered.
In this example it is recommended not to use grade 0 (zero) as the lowest grade because this value is set to be the noData.
